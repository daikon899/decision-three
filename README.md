This is a (sketch of) implementation of decision tree algorithm described in the textbook ["Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach) written by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig. 

I used entropy as impurity measure and implemented a pruning technique of rules in DNF form based on validation set errors. 

Hope this project would be useful for someone :)
