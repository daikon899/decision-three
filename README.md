# Description

This is an implementation of decision tree algorithm described in the textbook ["Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach) written by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig. 

The impurity measure is **entropy**. There is also a pruning technique on DNF of every possible path based on errors on validation set.

Hope this project would be useful for someone :)
