This is a (sketch of) implementation of decision tree algorithm described in the textbook "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" written by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig. I used entropy as impurity measure.

I also implemented a pruning technique of DNF based on validation set error. 

I hope this project will be useful for someone :)
