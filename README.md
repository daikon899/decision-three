This is a (sketch of) implementation of decision tree algorithm described in the textbook ["Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach) written by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig. I used entropy as impurity measure.

I also implemented a pruning technique of DNF based on validation set error. 

I hope this project would be useful for someone :)
